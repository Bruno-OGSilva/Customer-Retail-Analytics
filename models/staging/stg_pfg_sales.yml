    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw PFG sales data from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_pfg_sales` table and applies transformations
      such as renaming columns, casting data types, and deriving a unique store identifier.
      These steps ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for downstream analytics.

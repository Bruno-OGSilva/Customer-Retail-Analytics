    description: >
      This model extracts, cleans, and transforms raw LCL sales data from the POS system.
      Data is sourced from the `pos.raw_lcl_sales` table. The model renames columns, cleans
      currency values, casts data types appropriately, and creates a composite unique store identifier
      to ensure data integrity for downstream analysis.

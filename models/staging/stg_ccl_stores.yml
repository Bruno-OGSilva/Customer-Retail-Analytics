    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw store data for CCL from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_ccl_stores` table, renames columns for clarity,
      sets a hardcoded province value ('AB'), and derives a unique store identifier by
      concatenating `retail_group` and `Store Number`.

          A composite unique identifier created by concatenating `retail_group` and `Store Number`

          supports reliable joins in downstream models.

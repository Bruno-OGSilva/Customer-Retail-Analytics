    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms Federated Coop store data from the raw FCL sales dataset.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_fcl_sales` table, renames columns for clarity,
      assigns a constant banner value, and creates a composite unique identifier. These transformations
      ensure that the store data is standardized and ready for downstream analytics.
    columns:
      - name: store_name
        description: "Store name derived from the `Store Name` column."
        tests:

      - name: store_id
        description: "Unique store identifier derived from the `Store Number` column."
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: banner
        description: "Constant banner value ('Federated Coop') assigned to each record."
        tests:

        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: unique_store_id
        description: >
          Composite unique identifier created by concatenating `retail_group` and `Store Number`
          (i.e., store_id) with a pipe (`|`) separator. This field ensures that each store record
          is uniquely identifiable.
        tests:
          - not_null

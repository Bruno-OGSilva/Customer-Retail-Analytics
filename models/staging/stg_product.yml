    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw product data from the POS system.
      It pulls data from the `pos.raw_product_mf` source, selects key product attributes,
      and performs necessary type conversions, such as casting the UPC to an integer. This
      ensures that the product data is standardized and ready for downstream processing.

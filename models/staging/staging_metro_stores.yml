    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw store data for Metro from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_metro_stores` table, renames columns for clarity,
      and generates a composite unique identifier to ensure data integrity for downstream analysis.
    columns:
      - name: store_name
        description: "Name of the store derived from `Store Name`."

        description: >
          Composite unique identifier created by concatenating `retail_group` and `Operational Site`
          (i.e. `store_id`) using a pipe (`|`) as the separator. This field ensures that each store record is uniquely identifiable.
        tests:
          - not_null

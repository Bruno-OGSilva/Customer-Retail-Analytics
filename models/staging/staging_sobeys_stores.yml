      This model extracts and transforms the raw store data for Sobeys from the POS system.
      It pulls data from the source table `pos.raw_sobeys_stores`, renames columns for clarity,
      and derives a composite unique identifier by concatenating `retail_group` and `Store No`.
    columns:
      - name: store_name
        description: "Derived from 'Geography'; represents the store's name or location."

    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw store data for LCL from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_lcl_stores` table, renames key columns for clarity,
      and derives a composite unique identifier to ensure reliable joins and aggregations in downstream models.
    columns:
      - name: store_name
        description: "Store name derived from the `Store Name` column in the raw data."
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: store_id
        description: "Unique identifier for each store derived from the `Store No` column."
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: division
        description: "Operational division of the store, sourced from the `Division` column."
        tests:

      - name: banner
        description: "Store banner information, sourced from the `Store Banner` column."

        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: unique_store_id
        description: >
          Composite unique identifier created by concatenating `retail_group` and `Store No`
          with a pipe (`|`) separator. This field ensures that each store record is uniquely identified.
        tests:
          - not_null

  - name: staging_pfg_stores
    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw store data for PFG from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_pfg_stores` table, renames columns for clarity,
      standardizes province names into two-letter codes via a CASE statement, and creates
      a composite unique identifier for each store.
    columns:
      - name: store_name
        description: >
          Derived from `Store Name`; represents the store's name.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: store_id
        description: >
          Renamed from `Store Number`; serves as the unique identifier for each store.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: banner
        description: >
          Renamed from `Banner Name`; represents the store's banner.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: "Province Name"
        description: >
          The original province name from the source data.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: province
        description: >
          Standardized province code derived from `Province Name` using a CASE statement.
          For example, 'ALBERTA' is converted to 'AB', 'BRITISH COLUMBIA' to 'BC', etc.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: retail_group
        description: >
          Indicates the retail group to which the store belongs.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: unique_store_id
        description: >
          A composite unique identifier created by concatenating `retail_group` and `Store Number`
          (i.e., store_id) with a pipe (`|`) separator. This ensures that each store record is uniquely identified.
        tests:
          - not_null

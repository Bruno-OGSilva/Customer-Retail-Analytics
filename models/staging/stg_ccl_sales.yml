    description: >
      This model extracts, cleans, and transforms raw CCL sales data from the POS system.
      It pulls data from the source table `pos.raw_ccl_sales`, renames columns for clarity,
      casts data types for consistency, and derives a unique store identifier to support
      downstream analysis and reporting.

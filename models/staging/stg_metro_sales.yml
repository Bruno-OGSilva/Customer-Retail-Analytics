    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw Metro sales data from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_metro_sales` table, renames columns for clarity,
      casts numeric fields appropriately, parses the week end date, and creates a composite
      unique identifier for each store to ensure data integrity for downstream analysis.

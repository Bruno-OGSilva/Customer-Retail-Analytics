  - name: stg_fcl_sales
    description: >
      This model extracts and transforms raw FCL sales data from the POS system.
      It sources data from the `pos.raw_fcl_sales` table, renames columns for clarity,
      casts data types to ensure consistency, and creates a composite unique identifier.
      These transformations prepare the data for accurate and efficient downstream analysis.

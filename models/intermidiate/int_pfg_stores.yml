  - name: int_pfg_stores
    description: >
      This model enriches PFG store data by integrating discount banner information to classify each store into a sales channel.
      It sources data from the `stg_pfg_stores` staging model and the raw discount banners from `pos.raw_discount_banners`.
      The model assigns a channel value of 'Discount' if the store's banner matches any discount banner, and 'Conventional' otherwise.

    description: >
      This model refines raw LCL sales data from the POS system by applying necessary transformations,
      renaming columns, casting data types, and generating unique identifiers. It deliberately excludes
      the promotional sales columns (`promo_dollar_sales` and `promo_unit_sales`) to maintain a consistent
      schema for later appending with other retail accounts in the Mart layer.

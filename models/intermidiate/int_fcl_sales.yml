  - name: int_fcl_sales
    description: >
      This model refines raw FCL sales data from the staging layer (`stg_fcl_sales`) by excluding the `promo_type` column,
      which is not common to other retail accounts. The resulting dataset includes only the common fields needed for
      downstream aggregation in the Mart layer.

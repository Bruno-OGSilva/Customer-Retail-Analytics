    description: >
      This model enriches Sobeys store data by integrating discount banner information
      to classify each store into a sales channel. It sources data from the `stg_sobeys_stores` model
      and uses discount banner data from `pos.raw_discount_banners` to determine if a store is 'Discount'
      or 'Conventional'. This segmentation supports targeted downstream reporting and analysis.

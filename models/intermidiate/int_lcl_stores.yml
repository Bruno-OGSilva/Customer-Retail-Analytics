    description: >
      This model enriches local (LCL) store data by integrating discount banner information.
      It classifies each store into a sales channel based on whether its banner matches any discount banner
      from the raw source. The model relies on data from the `stg_lcl_stores` staging model and the
      `pos.raw_discount_banners` source to derive the final classification.

          Sales channel classification derived from the store's banner.

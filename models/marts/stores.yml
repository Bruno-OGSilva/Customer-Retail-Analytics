      This model consolidates store data from multiple retail accounts into a single, unified dataset.
      It unions data from the following intermediate models:
        - int_lcl_stores
        - int_fcl_stores
        - int_sobeys_stores
        - int_ccl_stores
        - int_pfg_stores
        - int_metro_stores
      The resulting dataset provides a consistent view of store information for comprehensive reporting and analysis.

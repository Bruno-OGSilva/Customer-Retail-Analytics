      This model constructs a comprehensive date dimension spanning six years from January 1, 2020.
      It generates a date spine and enriches it with key date attributes including year, month, day,
      weekday, quarter, weekend flag, and formatted month/year values. Additionally, it calculates
      the week start and week end dates based on business logic and integrates the business-specific
      week number (`w_no`) from the raw week number table.

      - name: date
